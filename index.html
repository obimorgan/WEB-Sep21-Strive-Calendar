        --------------- CALENDAR'S FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS ---------------  -> ANALYSIS
        - show the days of the month
        - user can click on a date to select it
        - user should be able to provide some information about a meeting, and create that new meeting accordingly
        - we should display all the saved meetings for the selected day
        - meeting details cover time and description
        - the selected day should be highlighted somehow
        - keep track of the saved meetings when we select other days

        -- NICE TO HAVE
        - show a visual hint on days that have assigned meetings
        - persist meeting data, so we won't lose that when refreshing the page
        - delete a saved meeting
        - edit a saved meeting
        - displaying the current month (with the appropriate number of days)
        - being able to switch among several months/years
        - why the heck are we expected to display 5 days per row?
        - should we display day names Sun to Sat or Mon to Sun?
        - show public holidays
